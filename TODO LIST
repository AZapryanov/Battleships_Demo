1. Add view models for connect activity and game activity
2. Merge game activity and connect activity
3. Sending only strings as extras and through BT as byte arrays is not optimal
4. Research what other type of data could be sent as extra and byte array, so that we do not need to make and use functions that transform strings to matrices and vice versa
5. Better differentiation which jobs should be done by the GameActivity and which in the Board class and its child class - InteractiveBoard, in order to minimize sending around entire board states
6. The Board class contains a drawCross function and logic in onDraw that are not needed in the EditableBoard, but are needed in the InteractiveBoard. Hence, they should be moved to the InteractiveBoard
7. In the GameActivity the observable mutable live data objects mIsMyTurn and mShouldWaitForOpponentAttack are of type Boolean. When they change value from true to false and vice versa the blocks of code in the observers executes. This is not a good practice and causes confusion
